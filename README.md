## üöÄ About the project

Digital implementation of the board
game <a href="https://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/codex-naturalis"> Codex Naturalis </a> by <a href="https://www.craniocreations.it/"> Cranio Creations </a>. <br>

This project features a single-server architecture that can handle **multiple games** at the same time.

Each game can contain **2 to 4** players (clients).

All players can play through a Text-based User Interface (**CLI**) or a Graphical User Interface (**GUI**). <br>

This project implements several Design Patterns from software engineering principles, and it is in fact based on the **MVC** Pattern (Model-View-Controller). <br>

Information about network messages and communication can be found into project `documentation`.

‚≠ê This project was graded **30Lüåø / 30**

## üìã Implemented Features

Apart from the basic rules of the game, we implemented a set of further features, including 3 out of 4 advanced
